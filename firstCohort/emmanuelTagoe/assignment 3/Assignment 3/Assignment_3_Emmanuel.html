    The name "Google" originated from a misspelling of "googol", which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed
    by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their first paper on PageRank: "We chose our systems name, Google,
    because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search
    engines."
